          "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "A startup typically benefits from hiring a Fractional CFO when it is experiencing accelerated growth, preparing for a fundraising round, or facing complex financial planning needs that exceed the skills of the founding team. This can include situations where investors demand more sophisticated financial reporting, when the business is expanding into new markets, or when the cash burn rate requires tight cash flow forecasting and working capital management. Unlike a full-time CFO, a fractional CFO provides strategic oversight without the fixed overhead, making it an ideal choice for early-stage or scaling businesses that need expert guidance without the full-time cost. In addition, startups in sectors like technology, hospitality, or tourism—where Eduardo Maass has deep experience—often encounter FX risk, regulatory complexity, and investor expectations that demand professional-level financial management early on."}

We handle budgeting and forecasting to align operational activities with long-term objectives, manage cash flow and working capital to avoid liquidity crises, and support fundraising by preparing investor-ready decks and valuation reports. Additionally, we provide risk management oversight, including FX risk mitigation, treasury management, and compliance monitoring. For B2B companies, we often add revenue model optimization, margin improvement strategies, and cost control frameworks to drive profitability. This comprehensive approach ensures financial strategies are not only technically sound but also aligned with the company’s growth trajectory."}

        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "How do you approach risk management for startups?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Our risk management process begins with a comprehensive business risk assessment that covers financial, operational, market, and compliance risks. For startups, we pay particular attention to liquidity risk, foreign exchange volatility (especially for businesses transacting in USD and MXN), and concentration risk in client or supplier bases. We then prioritize these risks using a probability-impact matrix and design mitigation plans that may include hedging strategies, diversification, insurance, or operational safeguards. Governance structures are implemented to ensure ongoing oversight, including board reporting, policy documentation, and KPI tracking for risk indicators. Our goal is not just to protect the business from downside events but to enhance investor confidence by demonstrating a disciplined approach to risk."}

        {
          "@type": "Question",
          "name": "Do you provide valuation reports for investors?",
          "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Yes. We provide professional valuation reports that are tailored for investor audiences. These can include discounted cash flow (DCF) models, market multiple analysis, and comparable transaction analysis, depending on the industry and stage of the company. Each valuation includes scenario analysis to account for best-case, base-case, and worst-case projections, along with clear explanations of the assumptions used. These reports are prepared in both English and Spanish to accommodate local and international investors, and they are formatted for integration into investment memorandums, pitch decks, or due diligence processes. Our valuations not only estimate a fair market value but also highlight the key financial drivers and risk factors that investors will scrutinize."}

          "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "B2B companies often operate with longer sales cycles, complex contract terms, and recurring revenue models that require specialized financial management. We design strategies that account for these realities, such as cash flow smoothing techniques to manage delayed receivables, cost allocation models to track project profitability, and pricing optimization frameworks to improve margins without losing competitive advantage. We also integrate KPI dashboards that focus on metrics like customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and churn rate, which are crucial for both operational decision-making and investor reporting. By combining these elements with risk mitigation and capital structuring advice, we help B2B companies achieve sustainable growth."}

          <p>
            I believe finance is more than numbers—it’s a lever for transformation. Over the past decade, I’ve worked with SMEs, family businesses, and startups to help them structure capital, refine margins, and turn financial complexity into clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Fractional CFO, I’ve seen how the right strategies—built on clear financial insight, precise valuation, and smart risk management—can do far more than improve the bottom line. They can unlock investment opportunities, accelerate growth, and create lasting value for both the business and the communities it touches.
          </p>
          <p>
            My approach is hands-on and collaborative. I work closely with founders and decision-makers to align their financial structure with their vision, ensuring that every decision not only drives profitability and cash flow, but also builds a foundation for sustainable, meaningful growth.
