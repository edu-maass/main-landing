        {"@type":"Question","name":"What problems does a Fractional CFO solve?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Fractional CFO closes the gap between bookkeeping and strategic decision‑making. Typical pain points include lack of forward visibility, unclear unit economics, missed cash risks, and investor requests for audit‑ready information. By implementing driver‑based models, monthly rolling forecasts, KPI dashboards, and cash control routines, we give founders a reliable cockpit for growth and fundraising."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How do you work with founders and teams?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Engagements start with a 360° finance review (reporting, processes, data, and risk) and a 90‑day plan. We meet weekly with founders and leads, build or refine the model, set KPIs, and implement cadences for cash, revenue, and margin reviews. We coordinate with accountants and legal to keep compliance tight while founders focus on customers and product."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What deliverables can we expect in the first 60–90 days?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can expect: (1) baseline model and 12–18 month forecast; (2) cash runway and working‑capital plan; (3) KPI stack and reporting templates; (4) investor‑ready metrics and a lightweight data room checklist; and (5) a risk register with mitigation actions for FX, liquidity, and operational exposures."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you support fundraising and investor relations?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. We prepare investor‑grade materials (model, valuation outline, metrics, cohort and margin views), support Q&A during diligence, and help align terms with the company’s capital strategy. We also install an IR cadence so updates are predictable and trust‑building."}}
