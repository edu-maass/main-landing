        {"@type":"Question","name":"What problems does a Fractional CFO solve?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A Fractional CFO closes the gap between bookkeeping and strategic decision‚Äëmaking. Typical pain points include lack of forward visibility, unclear unit economics, missed cash risks, and investor requests for audit‚Äëready information. By implementing driver‚Äëbased models, monthly rolling forecasts, KPI dashboards, and cash control routines, we give founders a reliable cockpit for growth and fundraising."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"How do you work with founders and teams?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Engagements start with a 360¬∞ finance review (reporting, processes, data, and risk) and a 90‚Äëday plan. We meet weekly with founders and leads, build or refine the model, set KPIs, and implement cadences for cash, revenue, and margin reviews. We coordinate with accountants and legal to keep compliance tight while founders focus on customers and product."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"What deliverables can we expect in the first 60‚Äì90 days?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can expect: (1) baseline model and 12‚Äì18 month forecast; (2) cash runway and working‚Äëcapital plan; (3) KPI stack and reporting templates; (4) investor‚Äëready metrics and a lightweight data room checklist; and (5) a risk register with mitigation actions for FX, liquidity, and operational exposures."}},
        {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you support fundraising and investor relations?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. We prepare investor‚Äëgrade materials (model, valuation outline, metrics, cohort and margin views), support Q&A during diligence, and help align terms with the company‚Äôs capital strategy. We also install an IR cadence so updates are predictable and trust‚Äëbuilding."}}

        <h1 class="h2">Fractional CFO Services</h1>
        <p>Strategic finance for scale: driver‚Äëbased planning, cash and working capital control, KPI architecture, investor‚Äëready reporting, and fundraising support. A Fractional CFO brings senior financial leadership without full‚Äëtime overhead, combining long‚Äërange planning with the operational cadence founders need to make weekly and monthly decisions. We design forward‚Äëlooking models that connect to accounting realities, build a reporting stack anchored in the metrics investors trust, and institutionalize cash controls that dramatically reduce surprise risk. The result is a finance engine that makes growth more predictable, improves margins, and shortens the path to investment readiness.</p>
        <p>Our engagements begin with a 360¬∞ review covering reporting, processes, data integrity, pricing and margin logic, and risk exposure. Within the first 90 days we deliver a 12‚Äì18 month forecast linked to revenue drivers, implement a KPI hierarchy tailored to your business model, and establish a cash and working‚Äëcapital routine that keeps liquidity visible weeks ahead of time. From there, we help founders align pricing strategy with contribution margins, redesign approval flows to protect gross profit, and build an investor narrative grounded in high‚Äëquality numbers. Whether you need to raise capital, navigate a pivot, or install reliable unit economics, our approach blends strategic thinking with hands‚Äëon execution so teams can move faster with confidence.</p>
